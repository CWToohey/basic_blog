This is a basic blog project initially written with political candidates in mind,
so there is a section for donations and comments are omitted!

To install, edit the .env file to set your database information, then use normal composer commands. Finally, seed your database:

php artisan db:seed

The default use name and password for the admin are:

jo@jo.com
password

You should change them for your install!
